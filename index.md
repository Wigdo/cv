## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">

Hi! Welcome to my digital resume. My name is Ari Wigdorowitz. I majored in philosophy and am now three quarters of the way through a law degree at Monash University. I am based in Melbourne Australia.

If you would like to see some of my academic essays you can find them on my [blog](https://wigdo.github.io/papyrus). I also plan on posting opinion pieces on 'what it takes to learn Chinese', some analytic philosophy and rough translations.
