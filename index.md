## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">

Hi! Welcome to my digital resume. My name is Ari Wigdorowitz. I have recently completed a Bachelor of Laws (honours) and Bachelor of Arts double degree at Monash University (LLB, BA).  I have also finished a Diploma of Languages in Mandarin (Diplang) and am fully fluent in the language having read the novel《活着》[To Live] by 余华 [Yu Hua]. Here you can find a succinct list of my academic achievements and a summary detailing my work experience and internship experiences.

I occasionally post an assortment of things on my [blog](https://wigdo.github.io/papyrus). It's worth checking out if you would like an insight into the kind of person that I am.
